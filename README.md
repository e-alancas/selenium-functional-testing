<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While I was a QA engineer at Wunderman Thompson I found myself creating a lot of new automation projects that included a lot of technologies and so far I decided to gather all that knowledge and bring everything together in this simple template that can provide standards, structure and configurations for automated testing.

This projects serves as a base template for creating a new application that can run functional web interactive tests using the power of the well known frameworks such as Selenium WebDriver & TestNG, and build in Java by Maven.

This was also visioned from the early development to be deployed in a CI/CD pipeline and automate the process of the running and notifying teams using the reports generated by this application.

Some of the advantages of using this project as a starting template are:
* Your time will be focused on creating test cases with low effort
* You won't be repeating code as crazy and do huge refactors when a breaking change arrives
* This can be used as a CI step in a pipeline

Of course, this template will serve as a base project and your needs may be different. So I'm down to add more features and functionality in the future, you can suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
